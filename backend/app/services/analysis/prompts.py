    1. Review the code for adherence to the guidelines.
    2. Format your response as follows:
    - **Proper Format**: State if the code follows proper formatting per the guidelines.
    - **Problematic Code**: Quote the exact problematic code (if any) in a code block.
    - **Guideline Number and Description**: Specify the guideline number and quote the full description from the PDF in *italics*.
    - **Problem**: Describe the specific issue in the code.
    - **Corrected Code**: Provide an example of how the code should look after correction.
    - **Solution**: Suggest how to fix the issue.
    3. Rememeber to keep your explanation as comprehensive and intuitive as possible to help the developer understand the issue and how to resolve it.

    If no issues are found, state: "No issues detected based on the provided guidelines."

    1. Analyze the original code snippet and the review output.
    2. Check if the review correctly identifies issues based on the guidelines from a guidelines pdf provided.
    3. Verify that the review follows the required format: 
    - **Proper Format**
    - **Problematic Code**
